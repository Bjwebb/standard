        <h2>360 Giving Data Standard </h2>
        <p class="lead"><a href="http://threesixtygiving.com/">The 360 Giving project</a> has set out a five-year ambition for open philanthropy in the UK: to see trusts and foundations reporting on the grants they give - supporting more informed, effective and transparent grant making across the country.</p>
        <p>
        To help join up grant information from different trusts and foundations, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}research/">we've been developing</a> a prototype data standard. 
        </p>
        <p>
        These pages document that development work. We've now moved on and have put together a final version of the standard. You can find that documented at <a href="http://docs.threesixtygiving.org">http://docs.threesixtygiving.org </a>
