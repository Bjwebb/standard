# From Zero to 360Giving: Getting Started

If you're here it means you've been reading about 360Giving and have decided that it's a good idea for you to release your grants information as Open Data. What you may not quite visualise, yet, is just what that actually looks like.

That's where this guide comes in. This guide is designed to get you started on the practical aspects of publishing Open Data in 360Giving. Luckily, we've been working towards making publishing in 360Giving as straightforward for you as possible. What this looks like for your organisation day-to-day may require just a little thinking about.

At any point in this process please feel free to contact our **free** helpdesk on [support@threesixtygiving.org](mailto:support@threesixtygiving.org) with any queries (big or small).

Broadly speaking, there are three phases involved in publishing your data as Open Data with 360Giving

+ **Plan:** Where you'll decide on the *what* and the *how* of your open data and consider things like Data Protection, as well as get set up to start on preparing your data.
+ **Prepare:** Where you'll do some nitty-gritty work of retrieving your data and getting it into a 360Giving format. You'll also check everything has worked by using our [Data Quality Tool](https://dataquality.threesixtygiving.org/).
+ **Publish:** This last bit involves getting your data out into the open; uploading it and letting us know about it!

Ready?

## Plan

**What's involved in this phase?**
By the end of this phase you will have produced (for yourself) a plan covering the scope of what you want to publish, which takes into considerationthings like Data Protection and licensing. You'll do several passes at your data to determine what to include.

The plan is for you to use internally to help your team make sense of your commitment to publishing your grant data, and what steps you're talking but *feel free to share it with us* if you have any questions or concerns. We'd love to hear from you!

**What are my tasks?**
These tasks are designed to act as a rough checklist to get you started. They are by no means exhaustive and you may not need some of them (you may add steps).

+ Decide on the scope of your data for your release
+ Determine whether there are any issues involving Data Protection and Privacy, and your strategy to work around them
+ Get in touch to register your [360Giving Prefix](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/register/)

### Deciding on the scope of your data
The 360Standard itself has got [minimum requirements]() about each grant to ensure that data is useful. However you retain control over the *scope* of information that you want to share. You may want to only ublish information between a cetain time period (e.g. last financial year) or around a particular theme or grant strategy you have.

Your should write in your plan details of the scope of the data you want to publish. It's always easiest to scale up, so don't worry about releasing everything yet. Some good questions to ask yourself:

+ Are there pragmatic or policy implications that block any data from being released now? If so, which data or grant programmes are affected? Which are unaffected?
+ Is the way you're operating now the same way as in the past? If not, you might want to focus on grants related toyour most recent strategy first.
+ How confident are you in your historical data? If you think there might be groups or inaccuracies going back, focus on data from a point you're confident in.

**Based on these questions, what is the scope of the data you want to share?**

Next we have to think about Data Protection and Privacy. In general, if you already publish grant announcements or similar on your website, annual report, etc., then you probably already have sufficient processes in place to accommodate releasing data.

+  Do grantees agree to any privacy policy or Terms and Conditions when submitting grant applications? If so, do these cover releasing information?

The next question to consider is whether you hold data which may be personal information in your grants (specifically in the scope defined before). Broadly speaking, data or information about organisations and the grants they've received can be made public and published using 360Giving without you needing to worry. However, you may have made *grants to named individuals* or to *organisations registered at a home address*. You should therefore ask the following questions:

+ In the scope you defined previously, is there any information about grants made to named individuals?
+ Does this scope contain any information about grants to organisations registered at a residential address?
+ Do we have personal information about a "Contact Person" around organisations that may need to be anonymised?

By asking these questions now you are making it easier for you to publish later by preparing for any extra steps that it will take to get the data ready. Once you've identified personal information it's good to idenfity the next steps you should take to get the data ready. There is an [ICO anonymisation code of practice](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1061/anonymisation-code.pdf) that offers useful advice e.g.

+ Replacing names with *"Grant to Individual"*
+ Reducing address information from a full address to a Postal Town or the first digits of a Postcode.
+ Abstracting the Contact Person names and emails away to be listed as the person's role and a generic email address.

**Based on these questions, what data in your scope needs to be tweaked to make it more suitable for publishing?**

You should also be *responsible* with the data you release. Some grants might be made in sensitive contexts. For example the address of a women's refuge.

+ Does any data in the scope contain sensitive information? If so what is your strategy for dealing with this?

You should be considering whether you should redact this information, or whether you should seek and manage consent around around a particular grant that you flag as sensitive. If you do decide that you want to seek consent then you should read our [guide on seeking and managing consent](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/do-we-need-permission-from-grantees-in-order-to-publish/).

**Based on these questions is there any data you need to redact or seek consent to publish?**

By now you'll have a fairly good idea of the shaope of the data you want to release and there's only one or two things left to do before you can start prepping for it

First we think that it's good practice to notify grantees of your intention to publish open data sets. This lets youassuage fears of personal data being misused and gives you an opportunity to tell them the benefits of publishing it. You should think about telling your grantees the following:

* What you're sharing *now*, and what you're seeking to share in the future (if you're scaling up to releasing more data later). You should also indicate what this consists of i.e. the fields of data such as grant description, amount, dates, etc.
* How you're sharing the information and how it will be available e.g. *"Through our website"* or via [GrantNav](http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/).
* Why you're sharing data this way.

**What are you going to say in your email to grantees?**

Finally, you'll want to register your 360Giving Prefix with us. This allows your grants to be identified properly by including it when listing your grants. You can request your prefix by simply getting in touch and emailing [support@360giving.org](mailto:support@360giving.org) and letting us know the name of your organisation. We'll message you back with your prefix.
