# Data Protection

## What is data protection?

The [Data Protection Act](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act) determines how personal information is used by organisations including charities, businesses and government bodies. The regulator is the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/) (ICO) and they provide a wealth of [guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/) on compliance.

## What does data protection have to do with open data?


[Open data](https://theodi.org/what-is-open-data) should not contain personal or sensitive personal data that could allow a living person to be identified (there are [exceptions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dft-senior-officials-business-expenses-and-meetings-april-to-june-2014) but these don't apply to [360Giving](http://www.threesixtygiving.org/)). Data published to the [360Giving standard](http://www.threesixtygiving.org/standard/) should be anonymised to protect privacy as outlined in the ICO's [anonymisation code of practice](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/anonymisation/).
